# üåê Custom Exa AI Search Engine

A custom AI-powered search engine built in Python using the [Exa API](https://exa.com).  
This project provides an interactive web interface with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), allowing users to perform intelligent keyword searches across the web, optionally filtering results by popular website domains.

## **Features**

- **Keyword Search:** Search any topic and get relevant results.  
- **Domain Filtering:** Filter results by popular websites such as YouTube, TikTok, GitHub, Reddit, and more.  
- **Automatic Domain Detection:** Detects if a query mentions a popular site and filters results automatically.  
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a clean and user-friendly experience.  
- **Clickable Results:** Search results are displayed as clickable links.  
- **Secure API Key Handling:** API keys are loaded from environment variables (`.env`) to keep them private.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/exa-search-engine.git
cd exa-search-engine
```
2. Install dependencies

```
pip install streamlit exa_py python-dotenv
```

3. Create a .env file in the project folder and add your Exa API key:

```
EXA_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```
Make sure .env is included in .gitignore to prevent exposing your API key.


4. Run the app

```
streamlit run search_app.py
```
A browser window will open with the interactive search interface.
